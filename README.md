Developing
----------

We use a handful of front-end tools, written in Node, to bundle scripts, do
cross-browser compilation and more. To do development work on the front-end,
you'll need to set up these tools. (Note: these instructions are only for
developers. This is not necessesary if you simply
want to use the front-end.)

Prerequisites:

- Node
- NPM

Install:

    npm install

Build:

    npm run build

If you're doing active development, and want your JS files to automatically
rebuild after you save, you can run

    npm run develop


Status
------
