# Contributing

We welcome contribution from everyone. Here are the guidelines if you are thinking of helping us:

- Contributions to openag-ui or its dependencies should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests.
- Each pull request will be reviewed by a core contributor (someone with permission to land patches) and either landed in the main tree or given feedback for changes that would be required.
- All contributions should follow this format, even those from core contributors.

## Pull request checklist

- Branch from the master branch and, if needed, rebase to the current master branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with master you may be asked to rebase your changes.
- Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).
- If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a comment.

## Issues

## Communication and resources

OpenAg contributors hang out in [the OpenAg forum](http://forum.openag.media.mit.edu). Anyone can join, and you can ask questions, share ideas and chat with other friendly folks.

## Philosophy

* Everything is a tradeoff. There is often more than one right answer.
* We take an iterative approach to engineering and design. The smaller the iteration loop, the faster and cheaper we can learn what works.
* We don't use the term "polish". It implies that quality is an afterthought.
* [We try to understand "why"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys).
* We try to be pragmatic.
